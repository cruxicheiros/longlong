# longlong
A longer long for the Arduino Uno.

Or - the result of my decision to write a long long as my first C project. If you somehow find this and use it in production, shaaaaaame.

Longlong supports:
 * Left & right shift
 * EQ, GT, and LT comparisons
 * Addition and subtraction
 * Multiplication and division
 * Boolean And, Or, Not, and Xor.
